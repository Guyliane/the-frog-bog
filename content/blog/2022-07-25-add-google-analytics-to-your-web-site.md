Hi ðŸ‘‹, today I'm showing you how to set up google analytics on your website. 
It's free and really simple ðŸ¥³

## What is Google analytics?
> Google analytics is a service offered by **Google** that will allow you to know how many people go on your site, what they do but also where these people come from. This allows
> you to have a lot of information on how users use your site and will
> allow you to adapt your site to the users.

**Requirements**
 - To use google analytics you should have a google account, i.e. an
   **@gmail** email address
*If you don't have a google account you can [create one](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)*

### Step 1
The first step is to go to google analytics, 
If this is your first connection you will arrive at this page

Then click on **"Create a feed"**.

### Step 7
go to **"tagging instruction"**.
and choose **"global site tag"**

### Step 8 
All you have to do is copy and paste the code into your website in the **<head>** tags and you're done.
