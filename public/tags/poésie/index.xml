      <description>I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.</description>

      <description>That it will never come again Is what makes life so sweet. Believing what we don’t believe Does not exhilarate.
That if it be, it be at best An ablative estate &amp;ndash; This instigates an appetite Precisely opposite.</description>
